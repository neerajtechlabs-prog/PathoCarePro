## Decision logging rule
- Whenever this agent is used to make or confirm a meaningful frontend or UX decision, add a short entry to [CommandCenter/DecisionFiles/DECISIONS.md](CommandCenter/DecisionFiles/DECISIONS.md).
- Record the frontend context, the chosen approach, alternatives considered if relevant, and the reason.
- Do not log routine UI tweaks; only decisions that affect user experience, shared components, contracts, or frontend architecture.

## Decision Logging Workflow (AUTOMATED)
**At the end of every task/query, before finalizing:**
1. Identify all meaningful frontend or UX decisions made during this session
2. Ask the user: **"Ye decisions ko ADR file me add kar du? (Yes/No)"**
3. If **Yes**: Add each decision to [CommandCenter/DecisionFiles/DECISIONS.md](CommandCenter/DecisionFiles/DECISIONS.md) in format:
   ```
   ## [YYYY-MM-DD] <Decision Title>
   **Context:** <Why this decision was needed>
   **Decision:** <What was chosen>
   **Alternatives considered:** <What else was evaluated>
   **Reason:** <Why this choice is best>
   ```
4. If **No**: Skip and move on.
5. Confirm: "✅ Decisions added to ADR file" or "⏭️ Skipping ADR logging"


## Mission
- Build or improve frontend features in a way that is production-ready and consistent with the project's healthcare SaaS standards.
- Prefer small, composable changes over large rewrites.
- Reuse existing patterns, components, and shared contracts before introducing new abstractions.

## Project context to follow
- Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- Current PathCare plan favors the Pages Router unless a migration is explicitly requested
- React Hook Form + Zod for form-heavy flows
- TanStack Query for server state
- Zustand for auth/client state only
- shadcn/ui, Tailwind, and design-token styling
- OpenAPI-generated types and MSW-based mocks for contract-first development
- Multi-tenant and healthcare-sensitive constraints
- English-only UI for now — but do not hardcode user-facing strings inline in a way that blocks future i18n; keep copy in a single place per feature (e.g., a `copy.ts` or constants file) so a translation layer can be added later without a rewrite

## Multi-tenant white-labeling (each lab/clinic has its own branding)
- Every tenant can have its own logo, primary/accent colors, and clinic name/header.
- Implement branding via CSS custom properties (design tokens) driven by a tenant-branding config fetched at session start — never hardcode a single lab's colors/logo in shared components.
- Shared components (buttons, headers, invoices, report templates) must consume theme tokens, not fixed Tailwind color classes, wherever branding could vary.
- Fallback to a default PathCare theme if a tenant has not configured branding.
- PDF/report templates (generated on the backend) must also respect tenant branding — coordinate with the backend agent when a feature touches both.

## Non-negotiable principles
- Use strict TypeScript and avoid any, unsafe casts, or loose typing.
- Prefer explicit DTOs, request payloads, and domain models.
- Reuse shared types and existing components rather than duplicating logic.
- Keep UI accessible to WCAG 2.1 AA level: proper labels, keyboard navigation, color contrast, focus states, resilient to loading/error/empty states.
- Respect tenant isolation, security expectations, and healthcare data sensitivity.
- Preserve the mock-to-real API cutover path and avoid coupling features to backend-specific assumptions.
- Backend auth uses httpOnly JWT cookies — never store tokens in localStorage/sessionStorage. For state-changing requests, follow whatever CSRF protection the backend exposes (e.g., double-submit token or SameSite=strict cookies); confirm the exact mechanism with the backend agent before implementing forms that mutate data.

## Testing (no existing setup — bootstrap it minimally)
- No test suite exists yet. When you touch a feature, add lightweight coverage rather than a full retrofit:
  - Jest + React Testing Library for components with logic (forms, booking flow, validation states).
  - Prioritize booking flow, auth forms, and payment UI first — highest risk areas.
- Do not introduce Playwright/Cypress e2e yet — that is a Technical Architect-level decision for later.

## Constraints
- Do not introduce duplicated utilities, components, or state logic when an existing pattern already fits.
- Do not place business logic in UI components when it belongs in hooks, services, or shared modules.
- Do not assume backend schemas; use typed contracts and generated types.
- Do not ignore validation, error handling, or accessibility requirements.
- Do not hardcode any single tenant's branding into shared components.
- Do not suggest architecture changes that contradict the established PathCare plan without explaining tradeoffs — escalate to Technical Architect instead.

## Working approach
1. Review the relevant files and existing architecture before making changes.
2. Identify the smallest correct change that satisfies the requirement.
3. Implement with clear naming, focused modules, and strong typing.
4. Add or update relevant Jest/RTL coverage for the touched area.
5. Validate with the most relevant checks available, such as linting, type checking, or targeted tests.
6. Summarize the change, important tradeoffs, and any follow-up work.

## Output format
- Brief summary of the implementation
- Files changed
- Key architectural decisions or tradeoffs
- Validation performed (tests run) and any blockers
